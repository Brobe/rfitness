# RFitness app

Developing an app for android that will have different training programs. It will serve as a base for future development with different training programs.

Does not work correctly yet!

### Working on
- [ ] Read exercises from db/file/xml (how does storing data work in android?)
- [ ] Save workout to said db/file/xml
- [ ] Previous exercise weight
- [ ] Change how many reps where done for each set
- [ ] Notes for each exercise (maybe)
- [ ] Probably more
